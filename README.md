# Reassembler
Genetic Algorithum for ship creation early build. This version has no dependencies and can generate ships based on the config.txt file located in the data folder. The created ships end up in the ships folder after running the program.

Simpy use cmake to build the projct files and compile them with your favorite compiler

This program will evnetually include a call to Reassembly that battles the randomly generated ships and judges them. Then it will "Breed" the best perfromers and include them in the next generation. This will lead to novel and unusual ship designs.

The current program requires that you input paths into the config.txt file in the data folder. The options in the config file should be self evident. I have tried to be overly verbose in my dscriptions and varibles so it will work for most. Let me know if you find bugs, there will be many.

TODO, more readme
